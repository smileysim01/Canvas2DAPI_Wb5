        <p>This workbook is due on Monday, March 6, 2023.</p><p>In this workbook, we&rsquo;ll get beyond straight lines to consider curves in 2D.</p>
<p>This is an exta large workbook. In the past it was 1 1/2 workbooks, but that didn&rsquo;t work out for various reasons. This year, it is a &ldquo;large&rdquo; workbook - with a different set of rules about timing and late policy.</p>
<p>This workbook is due on <strong>Monday, March 6th.</strong> That gives you 2 weeks to do it on time! Be aware that the cutoff (1 week later) is during Spring Break and there will be no consulting hours during break. Note that you cannot drop your score for this workbook.</p>
<p>The workbook is due the same week as the exam. The workbook is a good way to learn the key concepts (which will appear on the exam).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;programming project&rdquo; that goes with Curves is to make a train. It is now the last pages of this workbook.</p>
<p>Since it is bigger, this workbook has more points than most other workbooks. The scoring system still applies - 90=A, but this is your opportunity to score lots of points to raise your average!</p>
<p>Several pages have required exercises on them. But, as always, feel free to tinker with all of the provided example demos.</p>
<p>A warning: some of the things you need to complete the later parts of the workbook will only be discussed in the second week of curve lectures.</p>
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To understand the concepts of parametric curves and parameterizations</li>
    <li>To understand curve tangents, derivatives, and continuity conditions</li>
    <li>To understand piecewise polynomial representations of curves</li>
    <li>To understand cubic segments, and the need for different forms</li>
    <li>To understand arc-length parameterizations and how we approximate it</li>
    <li>To understand the ideas and properties of Bezier curves including their geometric and algebraic formulations</li>
    <li>To understand how we draw curves, including adaptation</li>
    <li>To be able to use curves in various APIs, including curve format conversion</li>
    <li>To practice some key computations with curves. (train)</li>
    <li>To implement various aspects of curves in the context of an application. (train)</li>
    <li>To appreciate why curve concepts, such as arc length parameterization and smoothness, are useful. (train)</li>
    <li>To write an interesting graphics program. (train)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="required-readingwatching">Required Reading/Watching</h2>
<p>The basic concepts are best learned visually. The workbook has interactive gadgets. The lectures will use the interactive gadgets and handwaves. And there are fantastic videos online. Two excellent ones are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds" target="_blank">The Continuity of Splines</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw" target="_blank">The Beauty of Bezier Curves</a> - these use fantastic animations to illustrate the concepts. Watch them. I don&rsquo;t know if its better to watch them first, or to watch the lectures and read through the workbook first. The videos present things in a different way and a different order.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> You will want to look at the book to see a bit more formalism and to have the equations written out (although, most of them are in the workbook). Curves are covered in <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/30140455/download?download_frd=1">FCG4_Ch15.pdf (0.5mb)</a>. It is best to read this after you watch the lectures and videos - the intuitions were hard to explain in writing (I can say that - I wrote the chapter). The workbook and lectures represent 20 years of me trying to find a better way to explain it. And the videos show what happens if you can spend a ton of time to make high quality animations.</p>
<ol>
<li>FCG 15.1 - basic ideas of curves, including parameterizations and piecewise representations</li>
<li>FCG 15.2 - curve properties (especially continuity)</li>
<li>FCG 15.3 - polynomial pieces - you need to have the basic intuitions, however, you will not need to do the derivations yourself.</li>
<li>FCG 15.4 - putting pieces together - this makes things sound more complicated than they are</li>
<li>FCG 15.5 - cubics - again, you won&rsquo;t have to derive the different cubic types, but make sure you know what hermites and cardinals are</li>
<li>FCG 15.6.1 - Bézier curves - very important, since they are what gets used in Canvas and many other things. The workbook and lectures will give you the intuitions, the book will show you the equations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 15.6.2 discusses B-Splines, a really cool topic, but one we will only touch on in class. Reading about it (either in FCG 15.6.2 or Hart) is totally optional. It is useful for some of the advanced points at the end of the workbook - and if you want to do graphics beyond class.</p>


<details class="myexpand" >
    <summary class="myexpand-head">Hart&#39;s Book - optional</summary>
    <div class="markdown-inner myexpand-content">
      <p>The Chapter of Hart&rsquo;s book (<a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/30140486/download?download_frd=1">Hart20-jan19.pdf (2.4mb)</a>) gets at the same material in a different way. You might find it helpeful. But it is optional. I recommend the YouTube videos instead.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hart 20.0 - basics of curves, a good review of the terms discussed in FCG 15.1-15.3</li>
<li>Hart 20.1 - the wiggle theorem - make sure you have the intuition that an nth degree polynomial has n-1 wiggles. I usually call this &ldquo;varation diminishing&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Hart 20.2 - Lagrangian curves - this is also 15.3.6 in FCG - understand the basic idea to know why we don&rsquo;t use these things.</li>
<li>Hart 20.3 - Hermite curves - these are in 15.3.4 and 15.5.2 of FCG. You won&rsquo;t need to derive them, but understanding what they are will be useful for Béziers and Cardinals, which we will use a lot.</li>
<li>Hart 20.4 - Bézier curves - these are important, so seeing them more than once may help.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the Chapter focuses on B-Splines and rational curves, which we won&rsquo;t cover in detail in class.</p>

<p><strong>Videos:</strong> The video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds" target="_blank">The Continuity of Splines</a> is a 60 minute crash course in splines. It is well animated with nice examples to motivate topics, and illustrations of what is going on with the math. The topics aren&rsquo;t exactly the ones we do in class, but it provides excellent to many topics - and the animations are fantastic. It has an awesome explanation of continuity, local control, and a bunch of  things we won&rsquo;t get to in lecture or the workbook.</p>
<p>The YouTube Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw" target="_blank">The Beauty of Bezier Curves</a> is a really nice introduction to Bezier curves. It is more focused than the longer video above. The video is a very nicely animated version of the same math in the workbook and my whiteboard derivations below. It goes on to explain arc length, and the methods for computing it. There is some overlap between this video and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds" target="_blank">The Continuity of Splines</a> - but the redundant parts are important, so seeing them multiple times isn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I made some videos of me at the whiteboard to explain the algorithms for Bézier curves. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw" target="_blank">The Beauty of Bezier Curves</a> shows it much better, but this is useful for showing you what you would actually do solving a problem yourself (like on an exam):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/1_ht8bd4ii" target="_blank">DeCastlejau 2</a> - Showing the algorithm for 3 points (a second degree curve)</li>
<li><a href="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/1_yfe2pejr" target="_blank">DeCastlejau 3</a> - Showing the algorithm for 4 points (a third degree curve)</li>
<li><a href="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/1_b45evtd7" target="_blank">DeCastlejau 4</a> - Shows the connection between the geometric constructions and the polynomial forms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rubric-for-grading">Rubric for Grading</h2>
<p>This workbook has a lot of points - you can get an A without doing any advanced points, and you can earn a lot of advanced points if you try. As always, your best bet is to focus on the basic points first - you get a lot of them for doing (relatively) easier things; the advanced points are trickier.</p>
